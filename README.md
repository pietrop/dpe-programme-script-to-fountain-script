## [DPE](https://github.com/pietrop/digital-paper-edit-client) programme script to fountain script

<!-- _One liner + link to confluence page_
_Screenshot of UI - optional_ -->

_Work in progress_

The ðŸ’¡ is that the output of [autoEdit 3](https://www.autoedit.io), [programme script](https://autoedit.gitbook.io/autoedit-3-user-manual/paperediting) could be exported as a screenplay script, using [fountain](https://fountain.io/).

> Fountain is a simple markup syntax for writing, editing and sharing screenplays in plain, human-readable text. Fountain allows you to work on your screenplay anywhere, on any computer or tablet, using any software that edits text files.

Code is borrowed and modified from

- [BadIdeaFactory/scriptchat](https://github.com/BadIdeaFactory/scriptchat)
- [thombruce/fountain.js](https://github.com/thombruce/fountain.js/blob/master/fountain.js)
- [brudil/timothy](https://github.com/brudil/timothy)

progress so far

- [x] can convert programme script `json` to `.fountain` text (this can be opened in [Final Draft](https://store.finaldraft.com/all-final-draft-products.html),[beat](https://lmparppei.itch.io/beat)([github](https://github.com/lmparppei/Beat/)), and [other screen writing softwares](https://fountain.io/apps))
- [x] can convert `.fountain` to `html`
- [x] dpe to word `.docx` file that looks formatted like a screen play (does not use fountain tho)
- [ ] âŒ› convert `.fountain` to pdf (see [example pdf output](./public/test.pdf) for progress so far )

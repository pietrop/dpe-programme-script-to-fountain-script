## section title

> A Scene Heading is any line that has a blank line following it, and either begins with INT or EXT or similar (full list below). A Scene Heading always has at least one blank line preceding it.

Power user: You can "force" a Scene Heading by starting the line with a single period.

## voice over

> Action, or scene description, is any paragraph that doesn't meet criteria for another element (e.g. Scene Heading, Character, Dialogue, etc.). Fountain respects your line-by-line decision to single or double-space, taking every carriage return as intentional.
